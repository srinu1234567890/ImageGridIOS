1. Image Grid: Implement a 3-column square image grid. Images should be center-cropped for consistency.

2. Image Loading: Implement asynchronous image loading using URLSession with provided URL.

3. Display: Enable scrolling through at least 100 images without lag.

4. Caching: Develop a caching mechanism for storing images in both memory and disk cache for efficient retrieval.

5. Error Handling: Gracefully handle network errors and image loading failures, providing informative error messages or placeholders.

6. Swift & Native Technology: Implement the solution in Swift using native iOS technologies, avoiding third-party libraries.
